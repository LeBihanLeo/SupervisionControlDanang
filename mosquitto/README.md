# Mosquitto MQTT Broker tutorial and documentation 

## Why do we need a MQTT Broker when we have OpenHAB?

[MQTT - Bindings | openHAB](https://www.openhab.org/addons/bindings/mqtt/) tells us : "MQTT is a server/client architecture.

A server, also called broker is not provided within this binding. You can use any of the freely available MQTT Brokers like [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/)."
