# openHAB

## First start of openHAB

You will be prompted to create an initial user/password combination.
This user will have full access to the openHAB console, which is a powerful tool that allows you to monitor and modify the state of your openHAB installation.
It is therefore recommended to choose a strong password.

Once you have created your username and password, openHAB is already configured, so you can skip the setup by clicking on the `Skip Setup` text, then `OK`


## Security Warning

It is vitally important that you MUST NOT directly expose your openHAB instance to the Internet (e.g. by opening a port in your firewall)!
